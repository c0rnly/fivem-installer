# fivem-installer

Hi, here is a small shell document with which you can install FiveM on your Linux server with 2 commands!
--> Upload the file to your server and run it. 
--> In most cases this is then [cd /home] if you put the files in the home folder and then only [bash fivem_home-oneclick.sh]

To start the server you only have to go with cd to the folder say [cd /home/fivem/serverfiles] and then [bash fivem.sh] and then [screen -r] that you see your txadmin data.
